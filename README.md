# Landing Page Project

This is my first landing page project as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations curriculum.  
The goal of this project was to practice basic HTML and CSS skills by building a static landing page from scratch.

## Objectives

- Structure a web page using semantic HTML.
- Style the page using external CSS.
- Use Flexbox to create responsive layouts.
- Apply basic design principles such as alignment, spacing, and visual hierarchy.

## What I Learned

- Setting up a basic project structure (HTML and CSS files).
- Writing clean and organized HTML markup.
- Using Flexbox for layout and positioning.
- Choosing and applying fonts, colors, and imagery for design.
- Building a visually attractive and functional static page.
